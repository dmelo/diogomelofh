This post is just a geek curious stuff about Linux.

pwd is a shell built-in command that show you the working directory. Good part of the built-in commands also have an external program that, in theory, behave just like the built-in one.

Well, that's the theory, in practice some external commands behave differently than the respective built-in. This post shows the example of the pwd command. When I type *pwd* here, the return is */home/dmelo*.

Now comes the weird demo. Create a symbolic link to /tmp into your home directory and go to your new link.

    dmelo@merov:~$ ln -s /tmp/ tmp
    dmelo@merov:~$ cd tmp

Now, prompt two commands, the first is *pwd* and then the second, */bin/pwd*. You will see something like this.

    dmelo@merov:~/tmp$ pwd
    /home/dmelo/tmp
    dmelo@merov:~/tmp$ /bin/pwd
    /tmp

The thing is that pwd built-in command does not care about where your symbolic link is pointing to. On the other hand, the program /bin/pwd cares. /bin/pwd follow replaces the symbolic link by the directory pointed by it. As the built-in commands have precedence over external commands, when you just type pwd it uses the built-in version of pwd.

See you in the next geek creepy story about Linux :D
