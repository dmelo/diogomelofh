A lot of people is getting this error today. Probably some bad update. They are
noticing it mainly on youtube. Anyway, in linux it is very easy to fix. Just
delete your PepperFlash directory.

    rm -rf .config/google-chrome/PepperFlash/

Please, comment if this doesn't work or if there is a better solution, or more
information regarding what is happening.
