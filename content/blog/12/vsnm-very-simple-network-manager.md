The code is written in python and is very easy to use. It can be found here
[https://github.com/dmelo/vsnm](https://github.com/dmelo/vsnm).

I'm very angry about the way NetworkManager manages my network. Not because it
uses graphical interface. But because when I want to change something by command
line, there comes NetworkManager minutes/seconds afterwards to creep everything.
I find it very hard to conciliate NetworkManager with command line management.

So I've created vsnm. For now, it only supports wifi (WPA/WPA2 and WEP) which,
I believe, are the most critical to have.

Have fun ;)
