It is the second time that the script `css_browser_selector.js` saves my day. This time I'm taking a better look on the script's advantages and pitfalls. The script's author is Rafael Lima. The script is available at his [site](http://rafael.adm.br/css_browser_selector/). This post is a review about the different ways to distinguish between browsers.

Here is how Rafael's script works. You include the script on your project and.... that's it. Just include his script and it's working. What the script does is add the `<html>` into a few classes. If the browser is Firefox3, running on Linux then the html tag will be like <html class="gecko ff3 linux js">.



It implies that you'll be able to code different behaviors on your site depending on the user's browser/operating system just like this:



<p class="code">

.ff3 body { /* set background color on Firefox3 to yellow. */

    background-color: yellow;

}

</p>



or



<p class="code">

.chrome.linux body { /* Set font to arial only if the browser is Chrome and is running on Linux. */

    font-family: arial;

}

</p>



The drawback is that, the script goes in action only after the entire page is loaded. If you have too much layout depending on css_browser_selector and the user browse your site, first he see a totally different site. Because the operating system and browser classes are not on the html tag yet. From this moment unti l the browser loads all your page, the page will start changing elements positions and colors, also depending on your implementation. At the point the browser ended loading the page, everything will be the way you planned.



There is a different approach. Bastian Allgeie ported the <a href="http://bastian-allgeier.de/css_browser_selector/">css_browser_seletor to PHP</a>. This approach have a huge advantage. The browser detection runs on server side. Your css won't wait until the end of page loading for the browser to apply the right rules. At the moment the browser starts using your style sheet code, the classes about operating system and browser version will be already at the html tag.



The weak point at Allgele's code is that it does not detect whether JavaScript is enabled at the browser. Another problem is that his code is not behaving well on Chrome. At the test on Chrome 5.0.375.86 beta, for Linux the script returned the classes <span class="code">"webkit safari chrome linux"</span>.



Somebody knows other tricks to determine browser/operating system or solve browser compatibility problems?
