Most of people who enjoy [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) likes very much the highlight that [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) does on programming languages like C, PHP, Java and even on Latex.

There is a few occasions where you want to paste a source file at your blog. Quite the same thing I did at [C++ - Timer](/blog/09/c-timer). One option is to take advantage of the your [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) settings and make [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) generate the Html file for your.

__The command is `:TOhtml`__. Type this command while you are on the file that you want to convert and [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) will split the terminal with the generated Html.

I hope it's as useful for you as it is for me :D. Don't forget to comment.
