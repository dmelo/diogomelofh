I have to admit, when it comes to window managing system, my taste is a bit
peculiar. But I'm glad to see other people also share my taste. I think the
simple the wm is, the better. Here is why I think that way.

/* frieldlyness */
User friendly wm tend to lose on productivity on the long run. If a user is
starting to use a new wm, friendly features are very useful. For experienced
users, those features are useless or not efficient enought. So friendliness
not only should not be a priority, it should be avoided, on the long run. The
priority should be efficient controls, shortcuts that empowers you to manage
your software efficiently.

/* memory footprint */
The memory footprint of wms like Gnome 3, Unity and KDE are too large. An
obvious argument is that wms like i3 are ideal for old machines. But more than
that, it gives an advantage even on modern systems. If your system have more
memory than you ever use, then you are wasting resources. On the other hand,
if your system often performs swapping, it probably means more memory will be
useful.

So, given that, even in a modern system, it will sometimes perform swapping,
to use a lightway wm, instead of a heavy one, will imply on a faster system.

/* peace of mind */
After you have mastered your lightweight wm, the advantages are huge. The
translation between what you want and how to do it comes easy.

Bellow I have listed a few features of I3 that I like.

Independent workspaces between different monitors
-------------------------------------------------

If you plug another monitor on your machine, which I often do, you can switch
between workspaces on one monitor withtout changing the other. I use this
feature on several ocasions. One of them is when I want to work while watching
a movie. I can set the external monitor to hold the video and switch between
workspaces on my main monitor without interrupting the movie.

Zero transition effects
-----------------------

At first, transition effects are beautiful. I remember start using Compiz and
configure my desktops to look like cubes. Seeing the transition from one face
to another was awesome, on the first day. After a while I had removed all the
transitions, not only to make it lighter but also to make it look lighter.

/* check nowsday */
Nowsday just want no transition effects at all. I see it as useless and resource
hog.

Automatically maximize space usage
----------------------------------

By default, the first gui occupy all the workspace. The second gui you open, 
on the same workspace, will split the space in two (horizontally or vertically).
Of course you control various aspects of how the windows are distributed but
the important thing is that you minimize waste of space. You don't reize windows
with the mouse, which would be counter productive.
