I have built an Mendel Prusa I3 Rework, on this final steps of
calibration, something wrong was happening that was making my printings too
weak, light and fragile.

I'm using the [slic3r](http://slic3r.org/) to generate the G-Code. The first
time I ran the software I had to configure the parameters for my printer. In
my case, what was causing the fragile printing was a wrong parameter.

I had the filament diameter set to 3 mm but my filament is actually 1.75 mm in
diameter. That was causing the printer to extrude almost half of what it was
suppose to.

After adjusting that value and regenerating the g-code, the problem was solved.
