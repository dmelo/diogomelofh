Here goes a small list of useful mplayer keys:

* f - full script
* z & x - delay subtitle
* j - enable/disable subtitles
* - & + - delay audio
* / & * - decrease/increase volume

That's it. Those are the keys I use the most.

While using mplayer to listen music I like the paramenter "-shuffle" that play the files on a random order.
