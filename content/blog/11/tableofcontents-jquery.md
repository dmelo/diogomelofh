Imagine that you are writing a tutorial, or a blog entry, for example. You divided your text in sections and (maybe) subsections. So you think, it would be nice to have a table of contents with links to each sections and subsection.

One way to do it is write that table manually. But this approach have a few problems: 1) you have to sort of copy/paste every title name and copy/paste by itself is something that should be avoided[1] and 2) on the future if you change the text you will always have to be careful with the table of contents.

Another approach is to use a jQuery plugin to automagically generate the table of contents for you. You just include the plugin, and call it and the table of contents will be there. If you change you won't have to change anything regarding to 

[1]: When the procedure of something includes copy&paste it's an indicator that the procedure could be better worked.
