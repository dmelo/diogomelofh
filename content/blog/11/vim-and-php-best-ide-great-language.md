The more I know vim, the more I love it. It's nobility relies on simplicity. It's considerable easy to extends doesn't require tons of RAM memory and so on.

Enough of cheap chat.

First of all, install the plugin to extract vimballs. Vimballs are VIM packages, like ".deb" for dpkg. You can find the installer here [vimball](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1502). This will be used by part of the following packages.

Here I intend to show a few interesting links to boost VIM for PHP programming.

Matthew Weier O'Phinney is the Zend Framework Project Leader. He wrote a few blog posts about VIM and PHP and you can find it here [http://weierophinney.net/matthew/plugin/tag/vim](http://weierophinney.net/matthew/plugin/tag/vim).

Also, Thomas Koch wrote a nice blog post about that too [http://www.koch.ro/blog/index.php?/archives/62-Integrate-PHP-CodeSniffer-in-VIM.html](http://www.koch.ro/blog/index.php?/archives/62-Integrate-PHP-CodeSniffer-in-VIM.html) but unfortunately he has turned to the dark side [http://www.koch.ro/blog/index.php?/archives/148-Ive-been-young-I-needed-the-money.html](http://www.koch.ro/blog/index.php?/archives/148-Ive-been-young-I-needed-the-money.html).

One great great thing is host on github [https://github.com/dmelo/vip](https://github.com/dmelo/vip). I had fork it from Tobias Schlitt. It integrates lots of features into one project. HIGHLY recommended :)

This post is still a work in progress... i will update it as I get to know more stuff wrote about this.
