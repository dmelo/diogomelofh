I have a virtual machine that runs Windows on my computer. I use it mostly to run IE and test browser compatibility. So I needed to make an address point to my host system. On Linux, I know exactly where to go: `/etc/hosts`. Googling about it, I found this site `http://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/Local-DNS-modifications-on-Windows-etchosts-equi.html`.

The equivalent `/etc/hosts` on windows is **`c:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`**.
