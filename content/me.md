Work
------

I've got my bachelor degree in Computer Sciences from the University of S達o
Paulo, in the beginning of 2010. My undergraduate research was around robot
soccer. On 2006 I designed and implemented strategies for robot soccer. During
2007 and part of 2008 I implemented a robot soccer simulator. The source code
is open and can be found on GitHub
[dmelo/uspds](https://github.com/dmelo/uspds.git).

Between 2011 and 2013 I went on persuing my master degree. Also at the
University of S達o Paulo. The subject of the research was data visualization and
relevance feedback applied to information retrieval The dissertation can be
found at
[USP's digital library](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/55/55134/tde-10072014-143431/en.php).

Currently, I work at [von Braun labs](http://vonbraunlabs.com.br/), as a
software developer. There I work on a wide variety of projects. We technology
stack is decided to be the best for each project. So, we end up working with
many different programming languages, frameworks, platforms. This is great both
for the projects we develop and for self growth.


Personal life
-------------

I like getting envolved with open software projects. See the
[/projects](/projects) for more details. I consider the computers, 
and everything that comes with it, to be the greatest achievement of mankind.
The ability to "transfer" toughts from my mind to a system and keep it running
forever is the closest thing I know to magic. It fascinates me.

I also like to spending with family and friends. I realy enjoy getting myself
into activities I know nothing or little about: climbing, archery,
food/wine/beer/coffee/chocolate tasting, cooking and so on.
