I was born in Goiânia, Brazil, in 1987. I always had an attraction for technology stuff and logical puzzles. Computing is a good way to get both things together. I started a bachelor degree in Computer Science at the University of São Paulo, in 2005. The course have 5 years duration and I'm on the schedule. Since 2006, I work at my undergraduate research. A robot soccer simulator <a href="http://uspds.sourceforge.net/simulacao.html">USPDS</a>. My research finished on the middle of 2009 but there is three more students developing the project.



I can consider myself very lucky because all my life I had very good people around me. I still learning too much with them. I like to reserve my free time to friends and family.
