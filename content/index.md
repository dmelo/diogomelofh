Hi, my name is Diogo Melo.

music. I started developing software in 2005, when I startted my B.S in 
Computer Science. I hope I never stop.

This site is mainly is about Linux, Web development and some quick geek tricks.
Whenever I solve some problem and I think it might be useful for others (or
for my future self), I post the solution here.
